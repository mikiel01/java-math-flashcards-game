A flashcard game written in ~2018-2019 to help my eventual stepson learn his addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (and to try to get him interested in programming).  I would have liked to make an options table instead of just manually changing the signs in the code, and add a slider to control the speed at which you have to solve the problem.
